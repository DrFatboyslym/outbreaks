# outbreaks: a compilation of disease outbreak data

This package compiles a series of disease outbreak data.
Data can be provided as R objects (loaded automatically when loading the package), text files distributed alongside the package, or functions generating a dataset.

The following R datasets are currently available:
```{r datalist}
data(package="outbreaks")
```




## Add your own data!

### How to add data?
We may try to automate the procedure at a later stage, but for now the addition of new dataset is manual. Acceptable forms are:
- as a `.RData` files in the `data/` folder (recommended)
- as a text file in the `inst/` folder
- as a function loading/assembling/simulating a dataset

### Naming Conventions
We use the lower cases and dots to separate words for the files and dataset names, so that for a `RData` object, a new dataset woud look like: `my.new.data.RData'. Try using informative names, typically using the disease first. Whenever available, order fields as:
   1. *disease*: mandatory
   2. *location*: optional
   3. *year*: optional
   4. *sim*: mandatory if this is a simulated dataset; otherwise data is assume to be an actual outbreak
   5. *other* (any other relevant information)
